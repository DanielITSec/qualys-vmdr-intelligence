# Qualys VMDR Intelligence & RBVM Framework

## 🛡️ Strategic Vulnerability Management
This repository serves as a professional portfolio demonstrating advanced implementation and automation strategies for **Qualys VMDR**. Instead of focusing on raw data, this framework emphasizes **Risk-Based Vulnerability Management (RBVM)** to bridge the gap between technical findings and business risk mitigation.
<br><br>

## 🚀 Key Framework Pillars
* **Data-Driven Prioritization**: Utilizing **Qualys Detection Score (QDS)** and **CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)** to isolate high-risk threats.
* **Automation-First Approach**: Leveraging **PowerShell** and Qualys APIs to streamline asset tagging and remediation workflows.
* **Business-Centric Reporting**: Translating complex vulnerabilities into actionable risk assessments for stakeholders.
<br>

## 📂 Repository Structure
* `queries/`: High-fidelity search tokens for identifying Ransomware exposure, Public Exploits, and Zero-Day threats.
* `automation/`: PowerShell scripts for automated asset tagging and API-based data extraction.
* `dashboards/`: Strategic dashboard templates (JSON) for VMDR prioritization and executive visibility.
* `docs/`: Methodologies for Risk-Based assessment and software compliance auditing.
<br>

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
* **Vulnerability Management**: Qualys VMDR (QDS, TruRisk).
* **Automation**: PowerShell / Microsoft Graph API.
* **Security Context**: Wazuh SIEM, Entra ID, and Windows Server infrastructure.
