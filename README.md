# Qualys VMDR Intelligence & RBVM Framework

## 🎯 Strategic Vulnerability Management
This repository serves as a professional portfolio demonstrating advanced implementation and automation strategies for **Qualys VMDR**. Instead of focusing on raw data, this framework emphasizes **Risk-Based Vulnerability Management (RBVM)** to bridge the gap between technical findings and business risk mitigation.
<br><br>

## 🚀 Key Framework Pillars
* **Data-Driven Prioritization:** Utilizing **Qualys Detection Score (QDS)** and **CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)** to isolate high-risk threats.
* **Automation-First Approach:** Leveraging **PowerShell** and Qualys APIs to streamline asset tagging and remediation workflows.
* **Business-Centric Reporting:** Translating complex vulnerabilities into actionable risk assessments for stakeholders.
* **Threat-Informed Defense:** Focused on Ransomware initial access vectors and weaponized exploits.

## 📂 Repository Structure
* **`queries/`** – High-fidelity search tokens for identifying Ransomware exposure and Zero-Day threats.
* **`automation/`** – PowerShell scripts for automated asset tagging and API-based data extraction.
* **`dashboards/`** – Strategic dashboard templates (JSON) for VMDR prioritization and executive visibility.
* **`docs/`** – Methodologies for Risk-Based assessment and software compliance auditing.
