# Qualys VMDR Intelligence & RBVM Framework - :construction:WIP:construction:

## 🎯 Strategic Vulnerability Management
This repository serves as a professional portfolio demonstrating advanced implementation and automation strategies for **Qualys VMDR**. Instead of focusing on raw data, this framework emphasizes **Risk-Based Vulnerability Management (RBVM)** to bridge the gap between technical findings and business risk mitigation.
<br><br>

## 🏛️ Key Framework Pillars
* **Data-Driven Prioritization:** Utilizing **Qualys Detection Score (QDS)**, **CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)** and public threat-intelligence to isolate high-risk threats.
* **Automation-First Approach:** Leveraging **PowerShell** and Qualys APIs to streamline asset tagging and remediation workflows.
* **Business-Centric Reporting:** Translating complex vulnerabilities into actionable risk assessments for stakeholders.
* **Threat-Informed Defense:** Focused on Ransomware initial access vectors and weaponized exploits.

## 📂 Repository Structure
* **`queries/`** – High-fidelity QQL search tokens for identifying vulnerabilities based on their real risks.
* **`automation/`** – PowerShell scripts for automated remediation of vulnerabilities.
* **`dashboards/`** – Strategic dashboard templates (JSON) for VMDR prioritization and executive visibility.
* **`docs/`** – Methodologies for Risk-Based assessment and software compliance auditing.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
* **Vulnerability Management:** Qualys VMDR (QDS, TruRisk).
* **Automation:** PowerShell | Microsoft Graph API | REST APIs.
* **Security Infrastructure:** SIEM | Entra ID | Windows Ecosystem | Hybrid Infrastructure (On-prem/Cloud).
